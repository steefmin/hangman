# Hangman Game

Start the fun with: 

```
mix serve
```
to start both Web Clients (b1 and b2 apps) on localhost:4000 and localhost:4001 respectively. 

or
```
iex -S mix
```
to start the interactive Elixir REPL that gives you access to the Text and AI clients: 

```
iex> TextClient.start()

iex> AiClient.start()
```
